title: Background
---

I'm currently a Software Engineer at [Andela](https://www.andela.com/) building things for the web with some awesome people. I graduated from [Africa University of Technology and Management, Benin Republic](http://www.uatm-gasa.com/) with a Bachelor Degree in Software Engineering.

As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design combining my technical skills with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful products. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

**When I'm not in front of a computer screen**, I'm probably catching up with latest episodes of my favorite tv series on Neflix, gaming or catching up with friends.
